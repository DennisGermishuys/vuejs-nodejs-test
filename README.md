# vuejs-nodejs-test
A small project learning to use vue with node

Had to complete this little project in about 2 days, as i had some constraints at work.

It turns our that i really like vue, so i will be expanding on this in the future in my free time.

Opted for vue and node, as these are technologies that i haven't used in a while, or haven't used at all.

As there was no dbms requirement, users are stored in an array on the backend.
The plan is to extend this to a dbms in the future, such as mongodb.

The reason for this is because i really want to work with noSQL databases.
